# README.md

This repository contains code snippets for building different chatbot applications using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Below, you'll find a description of each code snippet and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)
- `dotenv` library
- `gradio` library (for the last code snippet)

## Code Snippet 1: Chatbot App Ideas

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate ideas for building applications using OpenAI APIs. The code retrieves an API key from the environment variables, sets up the OpenAI library, and then makes a chat completion request to the model. The user's message is set to "Give me 3 ideas for apps I could build with OpenAI APIs." The generated response from the model is then printed.

## Code Snippet 2: Interactive Chatbot

This code snippet demonstrates how to create an interactive chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The code prompts the user to enter the type of chatbot they would like to create. It then enters a loop where the user can input messages, which are stored in a list of messages. The list of messages is passed to the model for chat completion, and the generated response is printed. The loop continues until the user enters "quit()".

## Code Snippet 3: Gradio-based Chatbot

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model and the gradio library. The code sets up a basic chatbot interface using gradio and defines a function that uses the OpenAI model to generate responses. The user's input is appended to the list of messages, and the model generates a response based on the entire conversation history. The generated response is returned as the output. The gradio interface is then launched, allowing users to interact with the chatbot.

## Getting Started

To get started with each code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file (e.g., app_ideas.py, interactive_chatbot.py, gradio_chatbot.py).
3. Set the appropriate environment variable for the API_KEY used in the code snippets.
4. Run the Python file (python app_ideas.py, python interactive_chatbot.py, python gradio_chatbot.py) and interact with the chatbot according to the specific code snippet's functionality.
